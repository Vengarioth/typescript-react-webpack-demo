# A typescript react and webpack experiment

## Global Dependencies
Before npm install run:
```
npm install -g typescript typings webpack
```

### typescript
The typescript compiler (tsc) as a cli tool.

### typings
The type definition repository, contains type definitions for common libraries like react. This enables the compiler to be very strict about external dependencies and prevents leaking of 'any' types into the codebase.

### webpack
The bundler, also provides a convenient dev server
